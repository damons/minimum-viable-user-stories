# A Minimum Viable Set Of Vulnerable User Stories

The here's a list of vulnerable user stories. My goal was to end
with a checklist that developers can hold up next to their product
and say yes or no or doesn't apply to the list of risks or challenges
this person faces as they navigate a life with this software in it.
This not meant to be comprehensive; all I want to do is set a bar,
knowing what we know about social software in 2016. The very lowest
bar you have to clear to consider yourself responsible developer.
